<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Arsh</h1>
<h3 align="center">Cyber Security Engineer & Penetration Tester · Red Team Mindset for Regulated Systems</h3>

### 🧭 Summary

I'm a Cyber Security Engineer with hands-on experience across **penetration testing**, **threat modelling**, **secure architecture review**, and **regulatory-aligned security verification**.

I like analysing complex systems end-to-end – at **system, application, and protocol layers** – to:
- identify **trust boundaries**, 
- reason about **abuse cases and attack paths**, and
- translate **risk into actionable engineering controls**.

My background covers **Linux and embedded platforms**, **network protocols**, **cloud environments**, and **automotive systems**, with a balance of **offensive testing** and **defensive design**. Increasingly, I'm interested in applying the same thinking to **fintech and high-risk SaaS**.

### 🛠️ Core Skills

- **Security Engineering**
  - Threat modelling (STRIDE, TARA), secure architecture review, trust-boundary analysis
  - Abuse-case–driven design and secure-by-design reviews

- **Offensive Security**
  - Manual penetration testing, protocol-level testing, service enumeration
  - Exploit PoCs, traffic manipulation, and adversary-style attack paths

- **Networking & Platforms**
  - TCP/IP, TLS, DNS, protocol analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
  - Linux security internals (permissions, services, hardening), Windows fundamentals

- **Cloud & Governance**
  - Cloud security fundamentals (AWS IAM, S3 policy analysis, logging)
  - Regulatory-aligned verification and evidence review (ISO 27001, ISO/SAE 21434, UN R155/R156)

- **Automation & Tooling**
  - Python and Bash for penetration testing tooling, protocol analysis, and security automation

---

### 🎯 What I'm interested in

- Red teaming / adversary simulation for **fintech** and other high-risk platforms  
- Hybrid **appsec + red team** roles (breaking apps, then helping teams harden them)  
- Building realistic **attack-path labs** that model how real breaches unfold across multiple systems

If your org cares about how an attacker would *actually* move through your environment – and how to prove coverage to auditors – we’ll probably get along.

### 🔍 Selected Projects & Labs

> Educational and lab-focused work. Only use tooling and PoCs on systems you have explicit permission to test.

- **[`hash-cracker`](https://github.com/c0ncatenate/hash-cracker)**  
  Simple Python hash cracker used to understand password handling and cracking workflows.

- **[`prometheus-ransomware`](https://github.com/c0ncatenate/prometheus-ransomware)**  
  Concept ransomware in Python, built to study attacker TTPs and discuss defensive controls and incident response.

  Public lab scenarios and PoCs will appear here over time, with a focus on:
  - authentication and messaging weaknesses,
  - protocol edge cases,
  - and attack paths that map cleanly to detection and mitigation work.
